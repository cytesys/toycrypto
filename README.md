## Introduction
This is a toy crypto library in C++ in the making. It has no dependencies, and should work on any platform (that has C++ standard libraries). This project has an executable (bin.exe), mostly for testing purposes, and CMake tests for every crypto function.

## Currently implemented cryptographic functions
*So far, only cryptographic hashing functions are implemented.*
- [x] SHA0
- [x] SHA1
- [x] SHA2
- [x] SHA3
- [x] MD2
- [x] MD4
- [ ] MD5

*This library is not meant to be used seriously, this is just me learning about crypto, C++, CMake and GitHub.*
