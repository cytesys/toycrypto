# toycrypto
![C/C++ CI](https://github.com/cytesys/toycrypto/workflows/C/C++%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)\
A toy crypto library in C++ in the making. HAs no dependencies (yet), and should work on any platform (that has C++ standard libraries).\
This is not meant to be used seriously, this is just me learning about crypto, C++, CMake and GitHub.
